**A well-formatted spreadsheet is easy to read. Spreadsheet programs have plenty of formatting features.**

# Adjusting column width and row height

**To adjust a column’s width or a row’s height, move your mouse cursor between two columns or rows. Click and drag to resize.**

**To automatically resize a row to fit the data entered in a cell, double-click between the current row and the row after it.**

# Cell formatting

**To access a cell’s formatting options, right-click on the cell and click 'Formatting options'. A dialogue box with the following tabs will appear:**

- **number – tell the spreadsheet what type of data the cell contains, eg currency, percentage, date, time, etc**
- **alignment – align the text in the cell vertically (top, bottom or middle), horizontally (left or right) or at an angle**
- **font – change the font used, text size and colour**
- **border – add a solid, dotted, dashed or coloured border to the cell**
- **fill – choose what colour or pattern the cell is filled with**

The name of these tabs may differ slightly between spreadsheet programs.

# Wrap text

**If the text in a cell exceeds the space available, wrap text will resize the cell so it fits.**

# Merge cells

**It is also possible to join two or more cells together to make one single cell.**

# Adding formatting

**Paul’s spreadsheet is messy and needs some formatting applied to make it more presentable and easier to read.**

- He centres 'Day', 'Description', 'Incoming' and 'Outgoing', bolds them and fills the cells with light grey to make them stand out.
- He also resizes the cells so the labels fit and increases the height of his rows to space them out.
- He changes the type of data in the cells beneath 'Incoming' and 'Outgoing' to ‘Currency’.
- He applies borders to all of the cells.
- He changes the vertical alignment of the cells in columns C and D to ‘Center’.
- It looks much better now but it needs a formula to work out how much money he’s left with at the end of the week.

# Formulas and functions

**Formulas and functions are extremely useful features. They make automatic calculations that update when the data does.**

# Formulas

**Formulas are usually simple calculations, eg adding two or more numbers together. They always start with an equals sign (=).**

# Symbols used in formulas

**There are a number of symbols used in formulas or calculations. These are the most common ones:**

- ‘+’ add
- ‘-’ subtract
- ‘*’ multiply
- ‘/’ divide

# Functions

**Functions make more complex calculations. Simple and regularly used functions include:**

- SUM – adds values in selected cells
- MIN – finds smallest value
- MAX – finds largest value
- AVERAGE – finds the average value
- COUNT – counts how many of the selected cells have numbers in them

**Like formulas, all functions start with an equals sign (=) followed by the function’s name, eg SUM, MIN, MAX, etc.**
