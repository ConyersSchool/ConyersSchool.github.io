Selection is a decision or question. **At some point, a program may need to ask a question because it has reached a step where one or more options are available.** Depending on the answer given, the program will follow a certain step and ignore the others.

**Selection is making a decision on which logical path to follow.** In a theme park, the queuing system for a roller coaster might read 'IF front row, queue here, else, all other rows queue here'.

# Why is selection important?

**Selection allows there to be more than one path through a program.**

**Many solutions feature several choices or decisions. These decisions lead to different paths through the program.** These paths represent the result of making a choice. **Without selection it would not be possible to include different paths in programs, and the solutions we create would not be realistic.**

# Selection in programming

**Once an algorithm has been designed and perfected, it must be translated – or programmed – into code that a computer can read.**

**We create programs to implement algorithms. Algorithms consist of steps, where programs consist of statements.**

Selection is implemented in programming using IF statements.

# IF statements

**Programs consist of a set of instructions that are carried out one after another. Sometimes there may be more than one path (or set of steps) that can be followed.** At this point, a decision needs to be made. This decision is known as selection.

**For example, this simple algorithm prints out a message depending on how old you are:**

- Ask how old you are
- IF you are 70 or older, say “You are aged to perfection!”

**The selection comes in step 2. If you are aged 70 or over, one message is displayed.**
