**The internet is a huge network of computers all connected together. The world wide web (‘www’ or ‘web’ for short) is a collection of webpages found on this network of computers.** Your web browser uses the internet to access the web.

So when you get home from school and ask to go on the internet, you should really say, ‘Can I look at some of the world wide web?’.

# How did the web begin?

## Sir Tim Berners-Lee

**In 1989 the world wide web was invented by Sir Tim Berners-Lee. He was trying to find a new way for scientists to easily share the data from their experiments.**

**Hypertext and the internet already existed at this point but no one had thought of a way to use the internet to link one document directly to another.**

## Three main technologies

**Tim suggested three main technologies that meant all computers could understand each other (HTML, URL and HTTP). All of these remain in use today.**

**He also made the world’s first web browser and web server.** You can still see pages from the first web server online.

# Why is the web so important?

**The world wide web opened up the internet to everyone, not just scientists.**

**It connected the world in a way that was not possible before and made it much easier for people to get information, share and communicate.**

**It allowed people to share their work and thoughts through social networking sites, blogs and video sharing.**

# Evolution of the world wide web

**The web has changed a lot since it was first created.**

**The first websites were made up of simple pages of just words and pictures, a bit like online books or magazines. Most people couldn’t create their own webpages. Back then, to make a webpage you had to write HTML code by hand.**

## Web 2.0

**As the web began to develop, people started communicating and sharing more. They used social network sites and blogs.** It became much easier to create your own content on the web and to share it. This new type of web became known as Web 2.0.

**Although the way people use the web has changed, the technologies haven’t.** Many of the technologies that ran the first webpages are still in use today.

## The modern web

**The web is still changing today. Search engines have become better at reading, understanding and processing information. They have found clever ways to find the content we want** and can even show us other things that might interest us.
