Charts and graphs provide a **visual representation** of data, which can often be easier to understand.

*To make a chart, use the chart wizard or the gallery, then follow the onscreen instructions.*

There are several types of charts. Choose a chart based on the type of data to be displayed. The charts you can choose from include:

- line graph – to show a change over time
- pie chart – show the individual parts that make up a whole
- bar chart – compare things that aren’t directly related
- scatter graph – look for a pattern or link between two sets of data
- Line graph showing temperature during the year

Always use logical title and **axis labels** so that your chart makes sense to others.

Paul could use a bar chart to quickly see if his incomings are greater than his outgoings.
