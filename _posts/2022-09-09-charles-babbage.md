**Charles Babbage, English mathematician and inventor Charles Babbage is credited with having conceived the first automatic digital computer.** He also designed a type of speedometer and the cowcatcher.

# Biography 

**Babbage was born on December 26, 1791, in London, England. In 1812 he helped found the Analytical Society, whose purpose was to introduce developments from Europe into English mathematics.** At about the same time Babbage first got his idea for mechanically calculating mathematical tables. **Later he made a small calculator that could perform certain mathematical computations to eight decimal places.** **In 1816 he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of London, the oldest scientific society in Great Britain.** **Then, in 1823, he received government support for the design of a projected calculator with a 20-decimal capacity.** He called it the Difference Engine. While he was developing this machine, he served as a professor of mathematics at the University of Cambridge.

# Analytical Engine

**In the mid-1830s Babbage developed plans for the Analytical Engine. It was the forerunner of the modern electronic computer. He envisioned the device as a general-purpose computing machine. It would perform any mathematical operation on the basis of instructions from punched cards.** The device would have most of the basic elements of the present-day computer. **In 1843 Babbage’s friend Ada Lovelace, a mathematician, translated a French paper about the Analytical Engine. In her annotations she described how it could perform a sequence of calculations. Scholars consider her notes the first computer program.**

**Lack of funding and technical constraints prevented the Analytical Engine from being completed. Babbage’s design was forgotten until his unpublished notebooks were discovered in 1937. In 1991 British scientists built Difference Engine No. 2 to Babbage’s specifications. In 2000 the printer for the Difference Engine was built.**

**Babbage made notable contributions in other areas as well. He published papers on mathematics, statistics, physics, and geology. He also assisted in establishing England’s modern postal system. Babbage died in London on October 18, 1871.**
