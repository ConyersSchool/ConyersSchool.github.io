**Sometimes we need computers to remember the information we give it and that it calculates during programs. A variable can be thought of as a box that the computer can use to store a value. The value held in that box can change or ‘vary’. A program can use as many variables as it needs it to.**

All variables are made up of three parts:
- a name
- a type
- a value

# Why use variables?

**Variables are extremely useful when programming. If a variable is used for the length of a side in a simple program to calculate the perimeter of a square, it is easy to calculate the perimeter of a different sized square**, simply by changing the value of the variable.

> **Variables are a key element of programming. They are used for calculations, for storing values for later use, in decisions and in iteration.**

# Iteration

**An algorithm is a plan, a set of step-by-step instructions designed to solve a problem.** There are three basic building blocks (constructs) to use when designing algorithms:

- sequencing
- selection
- iteration

**Algorithms are used to help design programs that perform particular tasks.**

# What is iteration?

**Algorithms consist of steps that are carried out one after another. Sometimes an algorithm needs to repeat certain steps until told to stop or until a particular condition has been met.**

> Iteration is the process of repeating steps.

For example, **a very simple algorithm for eating breakfast cereal might consist of these steps:**

- put cereal in bowl
- add milk to cereal
- spoon cereal and milk into mouth
- repeat step 3 until all cereal and milk is eatenù
- rinse bowl and spoon


The algorithm will repeat steps 3 and 4 until all the cereal and milk has been eaten.

# Why is interation important?

**Iteration allows us to simplify our algorithm by stating that we will repeat certain steps until told otherwise.**

**This makes designing algorithms quicker and simpler because they don’t have to include lots of unnecessary steps.**

# Iteration in programming

**Once an algorithm has been designed and perfected, it must be translated – or programmed – into code that a computer can read.**

**We create programs to implement algorithms. Algorithms consist of steps. Programs consist of statements. A statement is a single instruction - in other words, a single step.**

Iteration is implemented in programming using FOR and WHILE statements.

> In programming, iteration is often referred to as ‘looping’, because when a program iterates it ‘loops’ to an earlier step.
